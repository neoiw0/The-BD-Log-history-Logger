Neopet:The BD Log history Logger
//How 2 Use:

//1)Above the battle log,in the black bar, you will see how many times your multi-healers healed.(Make it easier for oneself to follow the DDL/EEL/OPT rules)

//2)Also, if there is a difference on MaxHp of 2 pets, this script helps note the number.The pet with higher health could immediately surrender when their health drops to or below this value, to make it a fair battle.

//3)BD log history
